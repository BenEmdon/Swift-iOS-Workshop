 # Welcome to the Tour of Swift!
 This is a Swift Playground where "people come to play".

 Swift Playgrounds are part of the Xcode Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE). What makes them special is that the code you write is compiled after every change, so you can see the results immediately.

 Swift is a [top-tier programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/apples-swift-programming-language-is-now-top-tier/) created by Apple, to develop responsive and efficient mobile apps, server-side applications, and even macOS.
 
 Swift is a relatively new programming language that uses Automatic reference counting (ARC) instead of garbage collection. In Swift, each object keeps a count of how many things point to it as a way of knowing if it's still useful to the program. If its internal count ever goes to zero then it is no longer needed by the program, and it destroys itself.

 View Controllers manage the the view hierarchy of your UIKit app. It manages all the UI elements such as buttons, text boxes, and images. It tells them where to go, and what to do. You could describe it as the glue that holds your app together.
 
 Stack Views are interfaces for laying out a collection of views in eaither a row or column. This allows for a UI that can dynamically adapt to the device orientation, screen size, or changes in available space. You can find an example of [Stack Views](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/LayoutUsingStackViews.html).
 
 Auto Layout allows your app to dynamically arrange and size UI elements, based off the constraints placed in each view. It allows for buttons to stay centred, for images to shink or grow based off the screen size, and for textboxes and buttons to remain the right distances apart.  A constraint is a basically a rule that tells your UI elements where to go, like stay evenly spaced between two other buttons, or exactly this far below another one. Using autolayout will ensure that your app looks good, no matter what screen size it's on.
 
 Swift Playgrounds are the perfect place to play, learn, and prototype your code.

// Lets start by printing "Hello World!".
// In Swift this can be done in one line:
print("Hello World!")
