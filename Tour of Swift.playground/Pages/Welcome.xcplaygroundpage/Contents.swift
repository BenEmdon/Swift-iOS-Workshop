 # Welcome to the Tour of Swift!
 This is a Swift Playground where "people come to play".

 Swift Playgrounds are part of the Xcode Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE). What makes them special is that the code you write is compiled after every change, so you can see the results immediately.

 Swift is a [top-tier programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/apples-swift-programming-language-is-now-top-tier/) created by Apple, to develop responsive and efficient mobile apps, server-side applications, and even macOS.
 
 Swift is a relatively new programming language that uses Automatic reference counting (ARC) instead of garbage collection. In Swift, each object keeps a count of how many things point to it as a way of knowing if it's still useful to the program. If its internal count ever goes to zero then it is no longer needed by the program, and it destroys itself.

 View Controllers manage the the view hierarchy of your UIKit app. It manages all the UI elements such as buttons, text boxes, and images. It tells them where to go, and what to do. You could describe it as the glue that holds your app together.
 
 Swift Playgrounds are the perfect place to play, learn, and prototype code.

// Lets start by printing "Hello World!".
// In Swift this can be done in one line:
print("Hello World!")
